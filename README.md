# Qiqihar: have fun with Boolean gates!

Qiqihar is a Python3 module to facilitate Boolean gate programming. The module contains common gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NOR, XOR, NAND, and provides support to construct complex Boolean circuits concisely using the gates.

I created this module mainly for my personal use. I was into Boolean gates and wanted to play with them in an easy way.

This module is named after Qiqihar(齐齐哈尔), a city in northern China.
